A journaling app for testing different web development tools.

Currently the app is built with [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/)

## Commands

Run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello).

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.
